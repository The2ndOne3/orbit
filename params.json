{"name":"Orbit","tagline":"Finally, a Node.JS framework that isn't brain surgery.","body":"# Orbit\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/The2ndOne3/orbit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/The2ndOne3/orbit)\r\n[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/generator-orbit.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/generator-orbit)\r\n\r\nOrbit is a loosely coupled framework that minimises black magic usage. Finally, an MVC framework that isn't brain surgery.\r\n\r\n## Philosophy\r\nSometimes, opinionated stacks are good. Boilerplates, scaffolding, and best practice structuring are all very helpful. But what if you only want part of a framework? What if you agree with socket wrapping but not policy-based authentication? What if you want Jade instead of Dust, or vice versa? Pulling out just the pieces you want usually requires several hours of learning how a deeply connected framework works, trying to make sense of poorly documented black magic.\r\n\r\nNot so with Orbit. Loosely coupled, but still opinionated. Well-documented, familiar, and easy-to-navigate inner workings. Want to use a different module? Just swap middleware and you're good to go.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nOrbit is packaged as a Yeoman generator. To install, run `npm -g install yo generator-orbit` and run `yo orbit` to start a project.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n### Package Management\r\nClient-side components are handled by `bower install`, which installs into `public/components`. Server-side components are handled by `npm install` into `node_modules`.\r\n\r\n### Server Daemon\r\n`npm start` will call `nodemon app.js` on port 8000. Don't like `nodemon`? Try `forever`. Need programmatic daemon control? Try writing a `daemon.js` instead using `forever-monitor`, then setting `npm start` to `node daemon.js`.\r\n\r\n### Server Middleware\r\nOrbit's server is a standard Express stack. It takes all standard Connect-compatible middlewares. Here's the default stack:\r\n* [Blade](https://github.com/bminer/node-blade) for view engine\r\n* [Helmet](https://github.com/evilpacket/helmet) for security\r\n* [Enrouten](https://github.com/paypal/express-enrouten) for routing\r\n* [Stylus](https://github.com/learnboost/stylus) + [Nib](https://github.com/visionmedia/nib) for CSS preprocessing\r\n* Automatic view rendering\r\n* 404 and 500 pages under 'errors' view folder\r\n\r\n### Routing\r\nOrbit uses `express-enrouten` as its default routing engine. Enrouten scans the `controllers` directory for any modules that export a function of the signature `function(app){ ... }` and passes them the Express app. Within each controller, you can then declare an arbitrary amount of routes using `app.get` as usual. See Enrouten's documentation for more details.\r\n\r\nIf a view exists but a route with its name does not, Orbit will automatically attempt to render that view without locals. For example, if only `app.get('/alice', ...)` and `app.get('/bob', ...)` are defined, a request to `/eve` will attempt to `res.render('eve')` before falling back to a 404.\r\n\r\nWant resourceful routing? That's basically the same thing as declaring a bunch of routes on different verbs, but Orbit supports it anyway -- just plug in [express-resource](https://github.com/visionmedia/express-resource).\r\n\r\n### Templates\r\nOrbit uses `node-blade` as its default client-side and server-side templating solution. Server-side templates are stored in the `views` folder while client-side templates are stored in `public/templates`. See Blade's documentation for more details.\r\n\r\nWant to use Jade as your templating language instead? Check out [jade-browser](https://github.com/storify/jade-browser) for client-side rendering and [grunt-contrib-jade](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jade) if you want precompilation. Server-side rendering works the same as vanilla Express.\r\n\r\n### Models\r\nOrbit doesn't come with a default model system, but recommends [Mongoose](https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose) for MongoDB databases and [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) for SQL databases. Anything that supports Express also supports Orbit right out of the box.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nOrbit uses [Mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) for testing by default, with [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai) as the assertions library and [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) for super-agent testing.\r\n\r\nOrbit doesn't come with a default client-side JavaScript testing framework, but recommends [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma) and [PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/).\r\n\r\n### Deployment\r\nOrbit uses a premade `Gruntfile.js` with the following default tasks:\r\n* `clean`\r\n  * Clean the `.build` folder\r\n* `build`\r\n  * Run `jshint` linting\r\n  * Compile Stylus files\r\n  * Link and optimise RequireJS files if using RequireJS\r\n  * Copy compiled files to `.build`\r\n* `test`\r\n  * Runs Mocha unit tests.\r\n\r\nWhen `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`, Orbit automatically compresses its responses and serves precompiled files from `.build` -- don't forget to `grunt build` beforehand!\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCopyright 2013 Lehao Zhang\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

{"name":"Orbit","tagline":"Finally, a Node.JS framework that isn't brain surgery.","body":"# Orbit\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/The2ndOne3/orbit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/The2ndOne3/orbit)\r\n[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/generator-orbit.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/generator-orbit)\r\n\r\nOrbit is a loosely coupled framework that minimises black magic usage. Finally, an MVC framework that isn't brain surgery.\r\n\r\n## Philosophy\r\nSometimes, opinionated stacks are good. Boilerplates, scaffolding, and best practice structuring are all very helpful. But what if you only want part of a framework? What if you agree with socket wrapping but not policy-based authentication? What if you want Jade instead of Dust, or vice versa? Pulling out just the pieces you want usually requires several hours of learning how a deeply connected framework works, trying to make sense of poorly documented black magic.\r\n\r\nNot so with Orbit. Loosely coupled, but still opinionated. Well-documented, familiar, and easy-to-navigate inner workings. Want to use a different module? Just swap middleware and you're good to go.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nOrbit is packaged as a Yeoman generator. Run `npm -g install yo generator-orbit` to install the generator.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n`yo orbit` will run the generator, after which `npm start` starts the server. See the [README](https://github.com/The2ndOne3/orbit) for more documentation.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n&copy; 2013 Lehao Zhang\r\nReleased to the general public under the terms of the Apache License 2.0.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
